# Phantom Rampage
this game was supposed to be expanded but i had to move on, to compile it use gradle run, since that's how i compiled it from the console, or gradle build, provided you have gradle, otherwise an IDE may do the job, sorry for lack of documentation, i am a practical person and this was my 2nd project, and there is no actual game engine, everything was done in code alone
